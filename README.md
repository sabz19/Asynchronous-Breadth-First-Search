# Synchronous BellmanFord

## Description </n>
Implements the BellmanFord algorithm based on a given network topology to find shortest distance from source to all vertices. </n> A global clock is maintained in order for the threads to report back to the master on completion of a round. The main method runs the master thread. </n>
## Usage
`javac BellmanFordMaster.java` </n>
`java BellmanFordMaster'

# Asynchronous Breadth First Search
## Description
Implements the Bread first search algorithm in an async simulated system. The async-ness is created by randomly generating time stamps for threads to send out hop values to other threads. <n>
## Usage
'javac BFS.java' </n>
'java BFS'
